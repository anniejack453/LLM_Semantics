mistral:7b,0,Where the Red Fern Grows,"Based on the normalized emotion vector of the book description for ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" and comparing it to the average emotion vectors of books that each age group enjoyed, I would recommend this book to the 14-15 age group.

Therefore, it could also appeal to the 14-15 age group but overall seems best suited for the 12-13 age group.",12-13,
