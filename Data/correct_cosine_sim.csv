""The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,"" Watson realizes.

With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow..."" <br /><br /><i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.<br /><br />In 1820, the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, made for the 3,000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions, the survivors clung to life as one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.<br /><br />Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost, unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told, the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature, drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources, including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.<br /><br />At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class, race, and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville, <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> will endure as a vital work of American history.",4.15,17.0,,

756,756,9780553240634,922193,The Right Stuff,[Tom Wolfe],"Tom Wolfe began <i>The Right Stuff</i> at a time when it was unfashionable to contemplate American heroism. Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. ""<i>The Right Stuff</i>,"" he explains, ""became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero."" <p> Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with <i>In Cold Blood</i>. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his ""characters"" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.</p><p> Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon).

2512,2512,9780679452355,2018856,Still Me,[Christopher Reeve],"Christopher Reeve has beaten the odds before. He scored his first role in a Euripides play at 15, costarred with Katharine Hepburn at 22, and was one of two advanced-program students accepted at Juilliard, to which 2,000 drama students annually apply. (The other advanced student became his best friend, Robin Williams.) Reeve rode a sailplane to 32,000 feet over Pikes Peak, fell 90 feet from a parasail harness into four feet of water and walked away. He survived emergency appendectomy, malaria in Kenya, and the disastrous film <i>Changing Channels</i>, with Burt Reynolds. He flew vintage airplanes upside down. On his first solo transatlantic flight, a radar controller informed him he was about to run out of gas 200 miles west of Iceland. The radar controller had misread his screen, and Reeve landed safely.<p> Then, in 1995, his horse balked at a 3-foot-3-inch racecourse fence, made an abrupt ""dirty stop,"" Reeve's hands got tangled in the reins, he landed on his head and got a ""hangman's injury""--a broken neck. Ace paramedics got oxygen to him 60 seconds before brain damage set in, and a helicopter named Pegasus lofted him to a hospital.</p><p> Reeve was already important. His interpretation of <i>Superman</i> was classic, and his starring role in <i>The Bostonians</i> launched the Merchant/Ivory school of filmmaking. But it was not until his paralysis that Reeve really got moving as a public figure of the first rank. As his memoir <i>Still Me</i> details, since the accident, Reeve has directed his first film, started the Christopher Reeve Foundation to fund spinal-cord-repair research, lobbied Congress, and crisscrossed the country on speaking engagements.</p><p> Says Reeve, ""Lindbergh made it across the Atlantic [where he was feted by Reeve's grandma]; Houdini got out of those straitjackets; with enough money and grass-roots support, why shouldn't I be able to get out of this wheelchair?"" Part Hollywood reminiscence, part scientific detective story, and part soapbox speech, <i>Still Me</i> explains the tantalizing but quite real possiblity that Reeve (and a quarter-million other paralyzed people, plus 49 million disabled Americans) may get back on their feet. Bobby Kennedy once tried to bolster Reeve's faith by saying, ""Just fake it till you make it. The prayers will seem phony, but one day they'll become real."" Christopher Reeve has more than a prayer, he has a program. He ain't fake, and he just might make it, leading a cast of millions. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>",4.09,19.0,,

Allied troops were sweeping through Nazi Germany and discovering the atrocities of SS concentration camps. The first to be reached intact was Buchenwald, in central Germany. American soldiers struggled to make sense of the shocking scenes they witnessed inside. They asked a small group of former inmates to draft a report on the camp. It was led by Eugen Kogon, a German political prisoner who had been an inmate since 1939. <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> is his classic account of life inside.<br /><br />Unlike many other books by survivors who published immediately after the war, <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> is more than a personal account. It is a horrific examination of life and death inside a Nazi concentration camp, a brutal world of a state within state, and a society without law. But Kogon maintains a dispassionate and critical perspective. He tries to understand how the camp works, to uncover its structure and social organization. He knew that the book would shock some readers and provide others with gruesome fascination. But he firmly believed that he had to show the camp in honest, unflinching detail.<br /><br />The result is a unique historical document—a complete picture of the society, morality, and politics that fueled the systematic torture of six million human beings. For many years, <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> remained the seminal work on the concentration camps, particularly in Germany.

The result will remind readers of <i>The Hot Zone</i>, Richard Preston's smart bestseller about the Ebola virus. That book focuses on the dangers of a freak accident; <i>Biohazard</i> shows how disease can become a deliberate tool of war. Alibek, once a top scientist in the Soviet Union's biological weapons program, describes putting anthrax on a warhead and targeting a city on the other side of the world. ""A hundred kilograms of anthrax spores would, in optimal atmospheric conditions, kill up to three million people in any of the densely populated metropolitan areas of the United States,"" he writes. ""A single SS-18 [missile] could wipe out the population of a city as large as New York."" <p> Chilling passages like these, plus discussions of proliferation and terrorism, make <i>Biohazard</i> a harrowing book, but it also has a human side. Alibek, who defected to the United States, describes the routine danger of his work: ""A bioweapons lab leaves its mark on a person forever."" An unending stream of vaccinations has destroyed his sense of smell, afflicted him with allergies, made it impossible to eat certain kinds of food, and ""weakened my resistance to disease and probably shortened my life.""

Sharing tender, painful memories and Nick's remarkable journals, Steel brings us a haunting duet between a singular young man and the mother who loved him--and a harrowing portrait of a masked killer called manic depression, which afflicts between two and three million Americans.<br /><br />Nick rocketed through life like a shooting star. Signs of his illness were subtle, often paradoxical. He spoke in full sentences at age one. He was a brilliant, charming child who never slept. And at first, even his mother explained away his quicksilver moods. Nick always marched to a different drummer. His gift for writing was extraordinary, his musical talent promised a golden future. But by the time he entered junior high, Danielle Steel saw her beloved son hurtling toward disaster and tried desperately to get Nick the help he needed--the opening salvos of what would become a ferocious pitched battle for his life.<br /><br />Even as he struggled, Nick's charisma and accomplishments remained undimmed. He bared his soul in his journal with uncanny insight, in searing prose, poetry, and song. When he was finally diagnosed and treated, it bought time, but too little. In the end, perhaps nothing could have saved him from the insidious disease that had shadowed him from his earliest years.<br /><br />At once a loving legacy and an unsparing depiction of a devastating illness, Danielle Steel's tribute to her lost son is a gift of life, hope, healing, and understanding to us all.",4.15,17.0,"{'Anger': 0.054214997005921625, 'Anticipation': 0.06167801459335979, 'Disgust': 0.03413249351283018, 'Fear': 0.0975681430060547, 'Joy': 0.09904300383685596, 'Sadness': 0.07465235423273968, 'Surprise': 0.02837166492936193, 'Trust': 0.10122757213511055, 'Objective': 0.4491117567477655}","{'Anger': 0.0636045854109906, 'Anticipation': 0.06882743021641906, 'Disgust': 0.036302883873952606, 'Fear': 0.09841155605819153, 'Joy': 0.10058088726674548, 'Sadness': 0.07668740040096643, 'Surprise': 0.03321338611011155, 'Trust': 0.10598365290700663, 'Objective': 0.4163882177556161}"

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br /><br />But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler.

3683,3683,9780312868604,267773,Ender's Shadow,[Orson Scott Card],"<i>Ender's Shadow</i> is being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning <i>Ender's Game</i>. By ""parallel,"" Card means that <i>Shadow</i> begins and ends at roughly the same time as <i>Game</i>, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. <p> Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of <i>Shadow</i>, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.</p><p> Although it may seem like <i>Shadow</i> is merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous <i>Ender's Game</i>, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of <i>Ender's Game</i> hinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, <i>Shadow</i> manages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that <i>Shadow</i>, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. <i>--Craig E.

There's only one safe place, and it has Ranger's name all over it---if she can find it. And if the Junkman doesn't find her first.

Bis eines Tages 13 Zwerge und der legendäre Zauberer Gandalf uneingeladen zum Tee kommen -- von da an sind die geruhsamen Tage des behäbigen kleinen Hobbits vorbei. Ohne Hut und ohne Frühstück bricht er mit den Zwergen auf, um in einem fernen Land einen verlorenen Schatz wiederzugewinnen. Doch vorher begegnen sie Elben, Trollen, Orks und Riesenspinnen, durchwandern das Nebelgebirge und den Nachtwald, bis sie schließlich zum Einsamen Berg gelangen, wo der Drache Smaug den Schatz der Zwerge bewacht.<p> <i>Der kleine Hobbit</i> ist ein Buch für Kinder ab 10 Jahren, die abenteuerliche Reisebeschreibung eines kleinen Wesens durch eine fremde Welt voller Phantasiegestalten. Aber gleichzeitig ist es auch der Grundstein und Auftakt des einflußreichsten Werkes der Fantasy-Literatur: <i>Der Herr der Ringe</i>. Der englische Sprachwissenschaftler Tolkien, der in seiner Gesellschaft die Verwurzelung in Mythen vermißte, hatte bereits vor dem kleinen Hobbit mit der Erschaffung einer völlig autonomen Phantasiewelt begonnen, die nicht nur eine eigene Schöpfungsgeschichte, sondern auch eine über viele Zeitalter währende Historie aufweist, mitsamt ihren Völkern, eigenen Sprachen und einer eigenen Geographie.</p><p> In dieser Welt spielt die Geschichte von Bilbo Beutlin, und auch wenn vieles noch nicht so deutlich ausgemalt ist wie später im <i>Herr der Ringe</i>, so spürt man doch, daß diese Welt existiert -- irgendwo, irgendwann. Die kleine Geschichte ist Teil von weitaus größeren Ereignissen -- was in <i>Der kleine Hobbit</i> passiert, ist erst der Anfang. So trifft z.B. Bilbo Beutlin tief unter den Bergen auf ein einsames, ausgezehrtes Geschöpf namens Gollum, das einen Ring besitzt, der unsichtbar macht. Dieser Ring wird vom arglosen Bilbo gefunden und mitgenommen -- und er ist es, der dem späteren Werk seinen Namen verleiht.</p><p> Ob man den kleinen Hobbit als Kind liest oder als Erwachsener -- auf jeden Fall ist es eine spannende, liebenswerte Geschichte, sprühend vor Phantasie. Eine Geschichte, die Sehnsucht erweckt nach mehr Geschichten von fremden Ländern, Abenteuern, Zauberringen und nach einem Wiedersehen mit jenem Wesen, dessen Erschaffung vielleicht Tolkiens größtes Verdienst ist: dem Hobbit. <i>--Birgit Will</i></p>",4.27,17.0,"{'Anger': 0.009099090090990901, 'Anticipation': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.012338766123387662, 'Fear': 0.015318468153184682, 'Joy': 0.0017741083034553688, 'Sadness': 0.016875455311611696, 'Surprise': 0.0, 'Trust': 0.0018312454468838832, 'Objective': 0.9427628665704859}","{'Anger': 0.009056528662420382, 'Anticipation': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.012281050955414012, 'Fear': 0.015246815286624204, 'Joy': 0.003531619654231119, 'Sadness': 0.01679651956323931, 'Surprise': 0.0, 'Trust': 0.004734417652411282, 'Objective': 0.9383530482256597}"

Their lives spanned world wars, the Depression, the rise and demise of the great Red Menace, and the emergence of the United States as a world power. <br />Through interviews with centenarians across the country, Bernard Edelman draws a dazzling portrait of Americans in the twentieth century, evoking the work ethic of rural farms, the nation's awe at inventions such as the automobile, and the collective despair at the onset of world war. These recollections are a treasure of the century's social history. The young immigrant survivor who can still smell the smoke of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. The rookie pitcher who struck out the first batter he ever faced in the big leagues: Ty Cobb. The dashing artillery officer who won a Silver Star in the Great War. The officer in the Quartermaster Corps who witnessed the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. The motorcycle racer who barnstormed the nation, setting records that will never be broken.

But as Clancy has constructed the Ryan mythology, he has quietly established Ryan's shadow double, John Clark. Appearing in <i><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382549.The_Cardinal_of_the_Kremlin"" title=""The Cardinal of the Kremlin"" rel=""nofollow"">The Cardinal of the Kremlin</a>, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32669.Clear_and_Present_Danger"" title=""Clear and Present Danger"" rel=""nofollow"">Clear and Present Danger</a>,</i> and <i><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19668.Without_Remorse"" title=""Without Remorse"" rel=""nofollow"">Without Remorse</a>,</i> Clark has many of Jack Ryan's most appealing traits, but he is also a darker figure embodying the more paranoid sensibilities of the late '90s. As is made clear from the opening pages of <i>Rainbow Six</i>, ex-Navy SEAL Clark and his colleagues believe violent, deadly force to be the best deterrent for terrorism. Clark (a. k. a. Rainbow Six) has left the CIA to create an England-based organization code-named ""Rainbow. "" Its mission: deploy an elite squad of American operatives combined with handpicked British, French, and German agents to stop terrorism in its tracks. Rainbow's emergence could not be more timely: in quick succession, the force diffuses three attempted terrorist actions. But Clark becomes suspicious when Russian agents suddenly show interest in Rainbow's work. Rainbow Six appeals on all the levels that Clancy fans could hope for. The Rainbow operatives, from Navy SEALs to German mountain-leader school graduates, are rendered to inspire with their physical and mental prowess. The book is infatuated with the latest gadgets for scrambling, transmitting, and decoding secrets. And, in a carefully woven narrative that simultaneously traces the Rainbow team, a former KGB agent named Popov, the Australian Olympic security team, and a sinister group of American scientists, Clancy artfully reveals the mystery of ""Shiva"" at the center of the novel. How does Clark measure up against Jack Ryan? He may be the perfect hero for a world with hidden villains.",4.09,18.0,"{'Anger': 0.03739016954110275, 'Anticipation': 0.04781351603721579, 'Disgust': 0.02706807519659793, 'Fear': 0.052780496585552464, 'Joy': 0.05758997378694295, 'Sadness': 0.028429354123775133, 'Surprise': 0.02763621226951073, 'Trust': 0.08002857560723166, 'Objective': 0.6412636268520706}","{'Anger': 0.043614941480071945, 'Anticipation': 0.053233584443343855, 'Disgust': 0.03791152933816438, 'Fear': 0.051184735291817655, 'Joy': 0.06094935224044, 'Sadness': 0.03293798712300915, 'Surprise': 0.029439824831217584, 'Trust': 0.09640539061074474, 'Objective': 0.5943226546411907}"

Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the <i>Tao Teh Ching</i> teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the <i>Tao </i>or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity. <br />John C. H.

The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts.

4819,4819,9780671866396,356609,Warriors Don't Cry: A Searing Memoir of the Battle to Integrate Little Rock's Central High,[Melba Pattillo Beals],"The landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling, Brown v. Board of Education, brought the promise of integration to Little Rock, Arkansas, but it was hard-won for the nine black teenagers chosen to integrate Central High School in 1957. They ran the gauntlet between a rampaging mob and the heavily armed Arkansas National Guard, dispatched by Governor Orval Faubus to subvert federal law and bar them from entering the school. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by sending in soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division, the elite ""Screaming Eagles"" - and transformed Melba Pattillo and her eight friends into reluctant warriors on the battlefield of civil rights. May 17, 1994, marks the fortieth anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, which was argued and won by Thurgood Marshall, whose passion and presence emboldened the Little Rock struggle. Melba Pattillo Beals commemorates the milestone decision in this first-person account of her ordeal at the center of the violent confrontation that helped shape the civil rights movement. Beals takes us from the lynch mob that greeted the terrified fifteen-year-old to a celebrity homecoming with her eight compatriots thirty years later, on October 23, 1987, hosted by Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton in the mansion that Faubus built. As they returned to tour the halls of the school, gathering from myriad professions and all corners of the country, they were greeted by the legacy of their courage - a bespectacled black teenager, the president of the student body at Central High. Beals chronicles her harrowing junior year at Central High, when she began each school day by polishing her saddle shoes and bracing herself for battle.

In the case of Islam, there has been much recent confusion in the Western world centered on distorted portrayals of its core values. Born of ignorance, such confusion feeds the very problem at hand.<br /><br /><em>In The Heart of Islam</em> one of the great intellectual figures in Islamic history offers a timely presentation of the core spiritual and social values of Islam: peace, compassion, social justice, and respect for the other. Seizing this unique moment in history to reflect on the essence of his tradition, Seyyed Hossein Nasr seeks to ""open a spiritual and intellectual space for mutual understanding."" Exploring Islamic values in scripture, traditional sources, and history, he also shows their clear counterparts in the Jewish and Christian traditions, revealing the common ground of the Abrahamic faiths.<br /><br />Nasr challenges members of the world's civilizations to stop demonizing others while identifying themselves with pure goodness and to turn instead to a deeper understanding of those shared values that can solve the acute problems facing humanity today. ""Muslims must ask themselves what went wrong within their own societies,"" he writes, ""but the West must also pose the same question about itself . . . whether we are Muslims, Jews, Christians, or even secularists, whether we live in the Islamic world or in the West, we are in need of meaning in our lives, of ethical norms to guide our actions, of a vision that would allow us to live at peace with each other and with the rest of God's creation."" Such help, he believes, lies at the heart of every religion and can lead the followers of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) as well as other religious and spiritual traditions to a new future of mutual respect and common global purpose.<br /><br /><em>The Heart of Islam</em> is a landmark presentation of enduring value that offers hope to humanity, and a compelling portrait of the beauty and appeal of the faith of 1.2 billion people.",4.3,19.0,"{'Anger': 0.010682708959985417, 'Anticipation': 0.049141676541184336, 'Disgust': 0.010919697384012397, 'Fear': 0.025023546926746274, 'Joy': 0.08178531279433661, 'Sadness': 0.02329778506972929, 'Surprise': 0.0058882508431318935, 'Trust': 0.13090875945674965, 'Objective': 0.6623522620241242}","{'Anger': 0.015470804189915909, 'Anticipation': 0.05271637233218444, 'Disgust': 0.01955181821243727, 'Fear': 0.039109249924217764, 'Joy': 0.0848368155740926, 'Sadness': 0.028718662639916476, 'Surprise': 0.0064948187401062075, 'Trust': 0.14123002997608652, 'Objective': 0.6118714284110429}"

There were so many trucks making deliveries that it might take an hour for a car to travel a few blocks. People blamed the truck owners and the truck owners blamed the little wooden pushcarts that traveled the city selling everything from flowers to hot dogs. Behind closed doors the truck owners declared war on the pushcart peddlers. Carts were smashed from Chinatown to Chelsea. The peddlers didn’t have money or the mayor on their side, but that didn’t stop them from fighting back. They used pea shooters to blow tacks into the tires of trucks, they outwitted the police, and they marched right up to the grilles of those giant trucks and dared them to drive down their streets. Today, thanks to the ingenuity of the pushcart peddlers, the streets belong to the people—and to the pushcarts.<br /><br />The Pushcart War was first published more than fifty years ago. It has inspired generations of children and been adapted for television, radio, and the stage around the world.

At seven, she knows she is an intruder in her parents' party, in her parents' life. But she can't resist the magic. Later, she waits for the click, click, click of her mother's high heels, the angry words, and the pain that will follow. Gabriella already knows to hide her bruises, certain she is to blame for her mother's rage--and her father's failure to protect her. Her world is a confusing blend of terror, betrayal, and pain. Her parents' aristocratic world is no safeguard against the abuse that knows no boundaries, respects no person, no economic lines. Gabriella knows that, try as she might, there is no safe place for her to hide.<br /><br />Even as a child, her only escape is through the stories she writes. Only writing can dull the pain of her lonely world. And when her parents' marriage collapses, Gabriella is given her first reprieve, as her father disappears, and then her mother abandons her to a convent. There, Gabriella's battered body and soul begin to mend. Amid the quiet safety and hushed rituals of the nuns, Gabriella grows into womanhood in a safe, peaceful world. Then a young priest comes into her life.<br /><br />Father Joe Connors never questioned his vocation until Gabriella entered the confessional and shared her soul. Confession leads to friendship. And friendship grows dangerously into love. Like Gabriella, Joe is haunted by the pain of his childhood, consumed by guilt over a family tragedy, for which he blames himself. With Gabriella, Joe takes the first steps toward healing. But their relationship leads to tragedy as Joe must choose between the priesthood and Gabriella, and life in the real world where he fears he does not belong, and cannot cope.<br /><br />Exiled and disgraced, and nearly destroyed, Gabriella struggles to survive on her own in New York. There she seeks healing and escape through her writing again, this time as an adult, and her life as a writer begins. But just when she thinks she is beyond hurt, Gabriella is once again betrayed by someone she trusts. Brought to the edge of despair, physically attacked beyond recognition and belief, haunted by abuse in her present and her past, she nonetheless manages to find hope again, and the courage to face the past. On a pilgrimage destined to bring her face-to-face with those who sought to destroy her in her early life, she finds forgiveness, freedom from guilt, and healing from abuse. When Gabriella faces what was done to her, and why, she herself is free at last.<br /><br />With profound insight, Danielle Steel has created a vivid portrait of an abused child's broken world, and the courage necessary to face it and free herself from the past. A work of daring and compassion, a tale of healing that will shock and touch and move you to your very soul, it exposes the terror of child abuse, and opens the doors on a subject that affects us all. <i>The Long Road Home</i> is more than riveting fiction.

7940,7940,9780553380293,1120354,Flags of Our Fathers,"[James D. Bradley, Ron Powers]","In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military history, James Bradley has captured the glory, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Here is the true story behind the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and indomitable will of America.<br /><br />In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jima—and into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches strewn with comrades, they battled to the island's highest peak. And after climbing through a landscape of hell itself, they raised a flag.<br /><br />Now the son of one of the flagraisers has written a powerful account of six very different young men who came together in a moment that will live forever.<br /><br />To his family, John Bradley never spoke of the photograph or the war. But after his death at age seventy, his family discovered closed boxes of letters and photos. In <b>Flags of Our Fathers</b>, James Bradley draws on those documents to retrace the lives of his father and the men of Easy Company. Following these men's paths to Iwo Jima, James Bradley has written a classic story of the heroic battle for the Pacific's most crucial island—an island riddled with Japanese tunnels and 22,000 fanatic defenders who would fight to the last man.<br /><br />But perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happened after the victory. The men in the photo—three were killed during the battle—were proclaimed heroes and flown home, to become reluctant symbols. For two of them, the adulation was shattering. Only James Bradley's father truly survived, displaying no copy of the famous photograph in his home, telling his son only: ""The real heroes of Iwo Jima were the guys who didn't come back.""<br /><br />Few books ever have captured the complexity and furor of war and its aftermath as well as <b>Flags of Our Fathers</b>. A penetrating, epic look at a generation at war, this is history told with keen insight, enormous honesty, and the passion of a son paying homage to his father. It is the story of the difference between truth and myth, the meaning of being a hero, and the essence of the human experience of war.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",4.19,18.0,,

9679,9679,9780553275568,922195,The Right Stuff,[Tom Wolfe],"Tom Wolfe began <i>The Right Stuff</i> at a time when it was unfashionable to contemplate American heroism. Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. ""<i>The Right Stuff</i>,"" he explains, ""became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero."" <p> Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with <i>In Cold Blood</i>. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his ""characters"" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.</p><p> Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon). The author also produces an admiring portrait of John Glenn's apple-pie heroism and selfless dedication. By the time Wolfe concludes with a return to Yeager and his late-career exploits, the narrative's epic proportions and literary merits are secure. Certainly <i>The Right Stuff</i> is the best, the funniest, and the most vivid book ever written about America's manned space program. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>",4.23,19.0,,

As Peter Theroux in the New York Times Book Review points out, ""Her wonderfully witty voice and her penchant for history lessons of the Nile both ancient and modern keep [her] high adventure moving for even the highest brows."" In her previous outing, The Last Camel Died at Noon, Amelia Peabody and her dashing husband, Emerson, discovered a fabulous lost oasis in the Nubian desert. Now, in the seventh mystery in the series, the Emerson-Peabodys are traveling up the Nile once again to encounter their most deadly adversary, the Master Criminal, who is back at his sinister best. Amelia Peabody was unabashedly proud of her newest translation, a fragment of the ancient fairytale ""The Doomed Prince."" Later, she would wonder why no sense of foreboding struck her as she retold the story of the king's favorite son who had been warned that he would die from the snake, the crocodile, or the dog. Little did she realize, as she and her beloved husband sailed blissfully toward the pyramids of ancient Egypt, that those very beasts (and a cat as well) would be part of a deadly plot. The expedition began so happily....Leaving their delightful, but catastrophically precocious, son, Ramses, back in England, Amelia hoped this romantic trip might rejuvenate her thirteen-year-old marriage and bring back the thrills that she feared were fading. She and her dear Emerson were returning to the remote desert site where they had first fallen in love, Amarna, the holy city of Akhenaton and his beautiful queen, Nefertiti. But their return would threaten not only their marriage, but their very lives with perils as chilling as a mummy'scurse. An old enemy was determined to learn Amelia and Emerson's most closely guarded secret: the location of a legendary long-lost oasis and a race of people bedecked in gold.

9973,9973,9780452264717,1276568,Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth's Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa,[Mark Mathabane],"I am always asked to explain what it felt like to grow up black under South Africa's system of legalized racism known as apartheid, and how I escaped from it and ended up in America. This book is the most thorough answer I have heretofore given. The last thing I ever dreamed of when I was daily battling for survival and for an identity other than that of inferiority and fourth-class citizen, which apartheid foisted on me, was that someday I would attend an American college, edit its newspaper, graduate with honors, practise journalism and write a book.<br /><br />How could I have dreamed of all this when I was born of illiterate parents who could not afford to pay my way through school, let alone pay the rent for our shack and put enough food on the table; when black people in Alexandra lived under constant police terror and the threat of deportation to impoverished tribal reserves; when at ten I contemplated suicide because I found the burden of living in a ghetto, poverty-stricken and without hope, too heavy to shoulder; when in 1976 I got deeply involved in the Soweto protests, in which hundreds of black students were killed by the police, and thousands fled the country to escape imprisonment and torture?<br /><br />In ""Kaffir Boy"" I have re-created, as best as I can remember, all these experiences. I have sought to paint a portrait of my childhood and youth in Alexandra, a black ghetto of Johannesburg, where I was born and lived for eighteen years, with the hope that the rest of the world will finally understand why apartheid cannot be reformed: it has to be abolished.<br /><br />Much has been written and spoken about the politics of apartheid: the forced removals of black communities from theirancestral lands, the Influx Control and Pass laws that mandate where blacks can live, work, raise families, be buried; the migrant labour system that forces black men to live away from their families eleven months out of a year; the breaking up of black families in the ghettos as the authorities seek to create a so-called white South Africa; the brutal suppression of the black majority as it agitates for equal rights. But what does it all mean in human terms?<br /><br />When I was growing up in Alexandra it meant hate, bitterness, hunger, pain, terror, violence, fear, dashed hopes and dreams. Today it still means the same for millions of black children who are trapped in the ghettos of South Africa, in a lingering nightmare of a racial system that in many respects resembles Nazism. In the ghettos black children fight for survival from the moment they are born. They take to hating and fearing the police, soldiers and authorities as a baby takes to its mother's breast.<br /><br />In my childhood these enforcers of white prerogatives and whims represented a sinister force capable of crushing me at will; of making my parents flee in the dead of night to escape arrest under the Pass laws; of marching them naked out of bed because they did not have the permit allowing them to live as husband and wife under the same roof. They turned my father -- by repeatedly arresting him and denying him the right to earn a living in a way that gave him dignity -- into such a bitter man that, as he fiercely but in vain resisted the emasculation, he hurt those he loved the most.<br /><br />The movies, with their lurid descriptions of white violence, reinforced this image of white terror and power. Often the products of abjectpoverty and broken homes, many black children, for whom education is inferior and not compulsory, have been derailed by movies into the dead-end life of crime and violence. It is no wonder that black ghettos have one of the highest murder rates in the world, and South African prisons are among the most packed. It was purely by accident that I did not end up a ""tsotsi"" (thug, mugger, gangster). It was no coincidence that, until the age of ten, I refused to set foot in the white world.<br /><br />The turning point came when one day in my eleventh year I accompanied my grandmother to her gardening job and met a white family that did not fit the stereotypes I had grown up with. Most blacks, exposed daily to virulent racism and dehumanized and embittered by it, do not believe that such whites exist. From this family I started receiving ""illegal books"" like ""Treasure Island"" and ""David Copperfield, "" which revealed a different reality and marked the beginning of my revolt against Bantu education's attempts to proscribe the limits of my aspirations and determine my place in South African life.<br /><br />At thirteen I stumbled across tennis, a sport so ""white"" most blacks thought I was mad for thinking I could excel in it; others mistook me for an Uncle Tom. Through tennis I learned the important lesson that South Africa's 4.5 million whites are not all racists. As I grew older, and got to understand them more -- their fears, longings, hop",4.15,17.0,,

Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's ""a real Creeper!""

Then, when she was eleven, she witnessed her grandmother’s violent death, before Avery herself was shot and left for dead. Miraculously she survived. The man responsible is serving time in a Florida prison. This traumatic experience propels Avery into a life of law and order.<br /><br />Her razor-sharp mind and ability to gather data and decipher evidence has made Avery an expert crime analyst for the FBI. But soon she will have to use every one of her adroit skills on a case that hits painfully close to home.<br /><br />Avery’s workaholic aunt, Carolyn Salvetti, is certain her (hopefully soon-to-be ex) husband sent her the gold embossed reservation to the posh Utopia Spa in the mountains of Colorado. At first she is resistant, but then figures it will be a welcome respite from the cutthroat advertising business, not to mention a networking extravaganza. Plus she persuades her niece to join her for the two weeks of luxury and decadence.<br /><br />But Carolyn never makes it to Utopia. Under false pretenses, she is taken to an isolated retreat by a handsome stranger with a dazzling smile, suave demeanor, and the darkest of motives. His name is Monk, a hired assassin. Now, with scant clues and fewer resources, Avery must track down and save Carolyn—and outmaneuver a brilliant killer who is part of an elaborate plot of madness and lethal vengeance.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",4.02,17.0,,

But first she was going to help Taylor pull off the scam of the season.<br /><br />Lucas Ross hated England. He hated the filthy air, the prissy men, and the simpering women. He'd come to London for one reason: to take his youngest half-brother home to live under the wide-open skies of his ranch in the Montana Territory. He'd been forced, incredibly, to purchase the boy's freedom from his legal guardian, who was not only Lucas's oldest half-brother --- and sole heir to their father's fortune --- he also happened to be the same vile scoundrel who had humiliated Taylor Stapleton. By marrying Taylor, Lucas figured he would gain financial freedom, help a beautiful lady --- and give his despised older brother a taste of his own medicine.<br /><br />Taylor consented readily to her grandmother's scheme. Without Lucas as her protector, when Lady Esther died she would become her uncle's ward, and no doubt be forced into a marriage that would benefit his pocketbook at the expense of her heart.

It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" <br /><br />So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland.

Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. <br /><br />Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival.

It tells the tale of a hidden home high in the hills. It is discovered one day by a little girl called Lucie, who is in search of her missing pocket handkerchiefs. She knocks on the tiny door, and meets Mrs Tiggy-winkle who does all the washing and ironing for the neighbouring animals. Lucie spends a lovely day helping her, and it's only right at the end of the day that she realises Mrs Tiggy-winkle is a hedgehog!<br /><br />Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world's best-loved children's authors of all time. From her first book, <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i>, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten.<br /><br />Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and protected for future generations to enjoy.<br /><br />Today Beatrix Potter's original 23 tales are still published by Frederick Warne, alongside a wide range of other formats including baby books, activity books and gift and sound books.<br /><br /><i>The Tale of Mrs Tiggy-winkle</i> is number six in Beatrix Potter's series of 23 little books.

The story of Hamlet, the young Prince of Denmark, his tortured relationship with his mother, and his quest to avenge his father's murder at the hand of his brother Claudius has fascinated writers and audiences ever since it was written around 1600. <p> For many years interest focused on both Hamlet's inability to avenge his father's death, claiming that ""the native hue of resolution / Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought"", and, according to none other than Freud, his oedipal fixation with his mother. However, more recently critics have turned their attention to <i>Hamlet's</i> bold theatrical self-reflexivity (most famously reflected in the performance of ""The Mousetrap""), its fascination with issues of theology and Renaissance humanism, and its dense, complex poetic language. What is so remarkable about the play is the way in which it tends to uncannily reflect the concerns of different epochs. As a result, Hamlet has been at different moments defined as a romantic rebel, an angst-ridden existentialist, a paralysed intellectual and an ambivalent New Man. Whatever subsequent generations make of <i>Hamlet</i>, they are unlikely to exhaust the possibilities of this most extraordinary play. --<i>Jerry Brotton</i></p>",4.02,16.0,,

Dass er auch zeitkritische Romane geschrieben hat, wissen die wenigsten. Der Roman <i>Fabian</i> entstand 1931 und beschreibt den moralischen und geistigen Verfall inmitten schwieriger politischer Verhältnisse. Für Kästner gehen in dieser Zeit politischer und moralischer Verfall der Gesellschaft Hand in Hand.<p> Fabian ist ein arbeitsloser Germanist, der durch die Großstadt Berlin zieht auf der Suche nach Arbeit, auf der Suche nach Kontakten. Wir erleben mit, wie er Menschen trifft, die ihn kaufen wollen, wie sich seine Freundin prostituiert, um Schauspielerin zu werden. Sein bester Freund begeht Selbstmord wegen einer lächerlichen Bemerkung. Ein Erfinder tritt auf, der seine Erfindungen, die Arbeitsplätze vernichtet haben, zurücknehmen will, was nicht geht. Die Stadt ist in Auflösung begriffen, die Menschen leben wie in einem Irrenhaus, einem hoffnungslosen, unbarmherzigen Labyrinth.</p><p> Fabian ist ein Außenseiter, ein Moralist, seine Waffe ist die Beobachtung, die Distanz, die durch sarkastische Bemerkungen hergestellt wird. Sein Anspruch besteht darin, zuzusehen, ""ob die Welt Talent zur Anständigkeit hat"". Kästner stellt dem Moralisten Fabian, ein Mensch übrigens, der moralisch integer ist, ohne dass ihm dies als Lebensentwurf bewusst ist oder er den Zeigefinger erhebt, menschliche Korrumpierbarkeit, Gewissenlosigkeit und Anpassung entgegen. So finden sich im Buch eine ganze Reihe von wirklich gelungenen satirischen Spitzen, wie z.B. eine Tombola, bei der Nahrungsmittel verlost werden oder eine Pöbelei von Menschen als Abendunterhaltung. Kästners Beschreibungen der Menschen sind bissig und schonungslos. Charakteristisch für die Moral der Menschen ist das Verhalten des Redakteurs Müntzer, der etwas unterstützt, an das er nicht glaubt und dessen Falschheit er durchschaut. Von Müntzer heißt es, dass er sein Gewissen chloroformiert hat. </p><p> <i>Fabian</i> ist ein Roman mit vielen wirklich gelungenen zeitkritischen Beobachtungen, die auch heute nichts von ihrer Aktualität verloren haben. Schließlich steht im Zentrum von Kästners Gesellschaftskritik die menschliche Schwäche, die Lethargie, genau um die Falschheit der Verhältnisse zu wissen, aber nichts dagegen zu tun -- und diese Kritik hat auch heute nichts von seiner Berechtigung verloren. <i>--Christoph Steven</i></p>",4.13,17.0,,

John Boyd: a talented football star hoping for a scholarship that will rescue him from his home in a housing project plagued by drug dealers... Jaimee Sheehy: a haunting figure aimlessly roaming the halls who avoids her classes, her future, and reality... Andrea Taylor: who breaks through racial barriers when she finds herself in the running to become the first black girl in her school's history chosen as Homecoming Queen... Mike Broom: the bright but embittered product of a broken home who is failing all his classes and sports a tattoo proclaiming anarchy. Welcome to high school at the end of the 20th century. YY, John, Jaimee, Andrea, and Mike are just five of the students that award-winning journalist Thomas French got to know during the unforgettable year he spent inside the walls of Largo High School in western Florida. In an attempt to discover firsthand what's really going on today in teenage America, French attended classes and faculty meetings. While hanging out in the cafeteria and going to football games and dances, he gained the trust of the students and obtained almost unlimited access into a world few adults can imagine. As he discovered, high school in the 1990s is more than the pep rallies, proms, driving lessons, and algebra tests you may remember. It is also a place where the pressure to succeed can drive students to commit suicide, where others hide guns inside their lockers, and where the usual tortures of adolescence are compounded by drugs, divorce, AIDS, and a widespread emptiness felt by so many teenagers. Newspaper headlines and the evening news only skim the surface of life in teenage America, and ""Beverly Hills 90210"" is far from how things really are. But South of Heaven tells the w",4.06,17.0,,

12983,12983,9780609609767,1860346,Love in the Driest Season,[Neely Tucker],"Foreign correspondent Neely Tucker and his wife, Vita, arrived in Zimbabwe in 1997. After witnessing firsthand the devastating consequences of AIDS on the population, especially the children, the couple started volunteering at an orphanage that was desperately underfunded and short-staffed. One afternoon, a critically ill infant was brought to the orphanage from a village outside the city. She’d been left to die in a field on the day she was born, abandoned in the tall brown grass that covers the highlands of Zimbabwe in the dry season. After a near-death hospital stay, and under strict doctor’s orders, the ailing child was entrusted to the care of Tucker and Vita. Within weeks Chipo, the girl-child whose name means gift, would come to mean everything to them. <br /><br />Still an active correspondent, Tucker crisscrossed the continent, filing stories about the uprisings in the Congo, the civil war in Sierra Leone, and the postgenocidal conflict in Rwanda. He witnessed heartbreaking scenes of devastation and violence, steeling him further to take a personal role in helping anywhere he could. At home in Harare, Vita was nursing Chipo back to health. Soon she and Tucker decided to alter their lives forever—they would adopt Chipo. That decision challenged an unspoken social norm—that foreigners should never adopt Zimbabwean children. <br /><br />Raised in rural Mississippi in the sixties and seventies, Tucker was familiar with the mores associated with and dictated by race. His wife, a savvy black woman whose father escaped the Jim Crow South for a new life in the industrial North, would not be deterred in her resolve to welcome Chipo into their loving family. <br /><br />As if their situation wasn’t tenuous enough, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was stirring up national fervor against foreigners, especially journalists, abroad and at home. At its peak, his antagonizing branded all foreign journalists personae non grata. For Tucker, the only full-time American correspondent in Zimbabwe, the declaration was a direct threat to his life and his wife’s safety, and an ultimatum to their decision to adopt the child who had already become their only daughter. <br /><br />Against a background of war, terrorism, disease, and unbearable uncertainty about the future, Chipo’s story emerges as an inspiring testament to the miracles that love—and dogged determination—can sometimes achieve. Gripping, heartbreaking, and triumphant, this family memoir will resonate throughout the ages.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",4.05,17.0,,

It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of ""the African""—Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the <i>Lord Ligonier</i> to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.<br /><br />Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins.

Guys don't seem to be called ""Lefty"" anymore. Most people don't know what they're doing, and a lot of them are really good at it.<br />Carlin also waxes wickedly philosophical on all sorts of subjects, including: KIDS--They're not all cute.

Geburtstag ein neues, unbeschriebenes Tagebuch geschenkt, nur wenige Wochen bevor sie und ihre Familie im von den Nazis besetzten Amsterdam untertauchen mußten. Ihre wunderbar detaillierten persönlichen Eintragungen zeichnen 25 anstrengende Monate klaustrophobischer, streitgeladener Intimität mit ihren Eltern, ihrer Schwester, einer zweiten Familie und einem älteren Zahnarzt nach, der wenig Toleranz für Annes Lebhaftigkeit zeigt. Der universelle Reiz des Tagebuchs beruht auf seiner fesselnden Mischung aus den schmuddeligen Besonderheiten des Lebens im Krieg (karge, schlechte Mahlzeiten; schäbige Kleider, aus denen man längst herausgewachsen ist, die aber nicht ersetzt werden können; die ständige Angst, entdeckt zu werden) und der offenherzigen Auseinandersetzung über Gefühle, die jedem Heranwachsenden bekannt sind: ""Jeder kritisiert mich, niemand erkennt meine wahre Natur, wann werde ich endlich geliebt?"" Aber Anne Frank war kein gewöhnlicher Teenager: Die späteren Eintragungen verraten einen für eine kaum 15jährige bemerkenswerten Sinn für Mitgefühl und spirituelle Tiefe. Ihr Tod verkörpert den Wahnsinn des Holocaust, aber für die Millionen, die Anne durch ihr Tagebuch kennengelernt haben, ist er auch ein sehr persönlicher Verlust. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>",4.15,16.0,,

Life among the warring factions in Scotland was dangerous for the infant Queen, however, and at age five Mary was sent to France to be raised alongside her betrothed, the Dauphin Francois. Surrounded by all the sensual comforts of the French court, Mary's youth was peaceful, charmed, and when she became Queen of France at the age of sixteen, she seemed to have all she could wish for. But by her eighteenth birthday, Mary was a widow who had lost one throne and had been named by the Pope for another. And her extraordinary adventure had only begun. Defying her powerful cousin Elizabeth I, Mary set sail in 1561 to take her place as the Catholic Queen of a newly Protestant Scotland. A virtual stranger in her volatile native land, Mary would be hailed as a saint, denounced as a whore, and ultimately accused of murdering her second husband, Lord Darnley, in order to marry her lover, the Earl of Bothwell. She was but twenty-five years old when she fled Scotland for the imagined sanctuary of Elizabeth's England, where she would be embroiled in intrigue until she was beheaded ""like a criminal"" in 1587. In her stunning first novel, The Autobiography of Henry VIII, Margaret George established herself as one of the finest historical novelists of our time. Now she brings us a new, mesmerizing blend of history and storytelling as she turns the astonishing facts of the life of Mary Queen of Scots into magnificent fiction that sweeps us from the glittering French court where Mary spent her youth, to the bloodstained Scotland where she reigned as Queen, to the cold English castles where she ended her days. Never before have we been offered such arich and moving portrayal of the Scots Queen, whose beauty inspired poetry, whose spirit brought forth both devotion and hatred, and whose birthright generated glorious dreams, hideous treachery, and murdered men at her feet.",4.06,16.0,,

Dabei halten sie sich alle für etwas ganz Besonderes.</p><p> Nur der Protagonist Watanabe glaubt, er sei ein Durchschnittsmensch mit Durchschnittsintellekt und Durchschnittskörper und merkt gar nicht, welche abstrusen Charaktere er um sich versammelt.

Oder seine Kommilitonin Midori, die beide Eltern bis zum Krebstod pflegte und die sich nun nackt vor das Foto ihres Vaters setzt, um ihm zu zeigen, dass sie inzwischen eine Frau geworden ist.

Freiwillig eingeschlossen in eine Nervenklinik versucht sie, den frühen Tod ihres Freundes Kizuki loszuwerden. Beide sind zusammen aufgewachsen und haben alles gemeinsam gelebt. Es war nie eine Frage gewesen, mit einem anderen Menschen zu leben. Doch plötzlich hatte sich Kizuki umgebracht, und sie war übrig geblieben. Wie einen Staffelstab gibt sie ihr Schicksal an Watanabe weiter, der Naoko liebt und den sie dennoch auf dieselbe Art verlassen wird, wie sie es einst wurde.</p><p> Der Leser merkt bei allem sehr schnell, dass zwischen der Entscheidung, beim Onanieren an jemanden zu denken und miteinander das Leben zu verbringen, kein großer Unterschied besteht. Dass es immer nur darum geht, dass man sich in der Welt versichert und jemanden findet, der einem die eigene Existenz abnimmt.</p><p> Haruki Murakami, der in Japan Millionenauflagen verkauft, schreibt darüber ein leichtes und gleichzeitig trauriges Buch, todernst und mit einem guten Schuss klugen Kitsches.

14313,14313,9783548250120,5171021,Der Hund von Baskerville,"[Arthur Conan Doyle, Nino Herne, Heinz Kotthaus]","We owe <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> (1902) to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher ""Bobbles"" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's ""a real Creeper!"" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. ""The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,"" Watson realizes. ""Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths.""

14395,14395,9781552781425,3764845,"Pianist:  The Extraordinary True Story Of One Man's Survival In Warsaw, 1939 1945",[Władysław Szpilman],"The last live broadcast on Polish Radio, on September 23, 1939, was Chopin's Nocturne in C# Minor, played by a young pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman, until his playing was interrupted by German shelling. It was the same piece and the same pianist, when broadcasting resumed six years later. <i>The Pianist</i> is Szpilman's account of the years inbetween, of the death and cruelty inflicted on the Jews of Warsaw and on Warsaw itself, related with a dispassionate restraint borne of shock. Szpilman, now 88, has not looked at his description since he wrote it in 1946 (the same time as Primo Levi's <i>If This Is A Man?</i>; it is too personally painful. The rest of us have no such excuse. <p> Szpilman's family were deported to Treblinka, where they were exterminated; he survived only because a music-loving policeman recognised him. This was only the first in a series of fatefully lucky escapes that littered his life as he hid among the rubble and corpses of the Warsaw Ghetto, growing thinner and hungrier, yet condemned to live. Ironically it was a German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, who saved Szpilman's life by bringing food and an eiderdown to the derelict ruin where he discovered him. Hosenfeld died seven years later in a Stalingrad labour camp, but portions of his diary, reprinted here, tell of his outraged incomprehension of the madness and evil he witnessed, thereby establishing an effective counterpoint to ground the nightmarish vision of the pianist in a desperate reality. Szpilman originally published his account in Poland in 1946, but it was almost immediately withdrawn by Stalin's Polish minions as it unashamedly described collaborations by Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Poles and Jews with the Nazis. In 1997 it was published in Germany after Szpilman's son found it on his father's bookcase. This admirably robust translation by Anthea Bell is the first in the English language. There were 3,500,000 Jews in Poland before the Nazi occupation; after it there were 240,000. Wladyslaw Szpilman's extraordinary account of his own miraculous survival offers a voice across the years for the faceless millions who lost their lives. --<i>David Vincent</i></p>",4.24,16.0,,

Hans Schwartz is Jewish, the son of a Stuttgart doctor who asserts that the rise of the Nazis is ""a temporary illness, something like measles which will pass off as soon as the economic situation improves.""

His agenda in this tome, which was first published in 1978 but didn't become a bestseller until 1983, is to reconcile the psychoanalytic tradition with the conflicting cultural currents roiling the 70s. In the spirit of Me-Decade individualism and libertinism, he celebrates self-actualization as life's highest purpose and flirts with the notions of open marriage and therapeutic sex between patient and analyst. But because he is attuned to the nascent conservative backlash against the therapeutic worldview, Peck also cites Gospel passages, recruits psychotherapy to the cause of traditional religion (he even convinces a patient to sign up for divinity school) and insists that problems must be overcome through suffering, discipline and hard work (with a therapist.) Often departing from the cerebral and rationalistic bent of Freudian discourse for a mystical, Jungian tone more compatible with New Age spirituality, Peck writes of psychotherapy as an exercise in ""love"" and ""spiritual growth,"" asserts that ""our unconscious is God"" and affirms his belief in miracles, reincarnation and telepathy. Peck's synthesis of such clashing elements (he even throws in a little thermodynamics) is held together by a warm and lucid discussion of psychiatric principles and moving accounts of his own patients' struggles and breakthroughs.

15120,15120,9780452273054,907781,The Bluest Eye,[Toni Morrison],"Originally published in 1970, The Bluest Eye is Toni Morrison's first novel. In an afterword written more than two decades later, the author expressed her dissatisfaction with the book's language and structure: ""It required a sophistication unavailable to me."" Perhaps we can chalk up this verdict to modesty, or to the Nobel laureate's impossibly high standards of quality control. In any case, her debut is nothing if not sophisticated, in terms of both narrative ingenuity and rhetorical sweep. It also shows the young author drawing a bead on the subjects that would dominate much of her career: racial hatred, historical memory, and the dazzling or degrading power of language itself.<br /><br />Set in Lorain, Ohio, in 1941, The Bluest Eye is something of an ensemble piece. The point of view is passed like a baton from one character to the next, with Morrison's own voice functioning as a kind of gold standard throughout. The focus, though, is on an 11-year-old black girl named Pecola Breedlove, whose entire family has been given a cosmetic cross to bear:<br /><br /> You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.... And they took the ugliness in their hands, threw it as a mantle over them, and went about the world with it. <br /><br />There are far uglier things in the world than, well, ugliness, and poor Pecola is subjected to most of them. She's spat upon, ridiculed, and ultimately raped and impregnated by her own father. No wonder she yearns to be the very opposite of what she is--yearns, in other words, to be a white child, possessed of the blondest hair and the bluest eye.<br /><br />This vein of self-hatred is exactly what keeps Morrison's novel from devolving into a cut-and-dried scenario of victimization. She may in fact pin too much of the blame on the beauty myth: ""Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another--physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion."" Yet the destructive power of these ideas is essentially colorblind, which gives The Bluest Eye the sort of universal reach that Morrison's imitators can only dream of. And that, combined with the novel's modulated pathos and musical, fine-grained language, makes for not merely a sophisticated debut but a permanent one. --James Marcus",4.06,16.0,,

Mais une nuit, une vision suffisamment obsédante pour réveiller sa cicatrice en forme d'éclair met les nerfs de Harry à vif et le pousse à contacter son parrain en sorcellerie, Sirius Black. Heureusement, la perspective d'assister au grand événement sportif de la saison, la Coupe du monde de Quidditch, suffit à faire oublier pour quelque temps à Harry que Lord Voldemort et ses sinistres comparses, les mangeurs de Mort, sont en route pour tuer.<br /><br />Lecteurs, nous allons maintenant recouvrir le reste de l'intrigue d'une immense cape d'invisibilité et nous nous bornerons à vous révéler que Qui-Vous-Savez est à la poursuite de Harry, et que cette année, il n'y aura pas de matchs de Quidditch entre Gryffondor, Serdaigle, Poufsouffle et Serpentard.

L'une d'elles est un palais miniature rempli de vrais paons ; une autre est composée de trois étages surplombés de nombreuses tourelles. Sans parler de tous les accessoires et gadgets proposés au public : des badges qui couinent le nom des joueurs, des modèles réduits de balais Éclairs de feu qui volent vraiment, ainsi que des figurines de joueurs célèbres à collectionner, qui déambulent dans la paume de la main en se pavanant... Il va sans dire que les deux équipes ne se ressemblent pas du tout, et leurs mascottes non plus. La Bulgarie est soutenue par les magnifiques Veela qui enchantent en un instant tous les spectateurs - y compris les supporters d'Irlande - jusqu'à ce que des milliers de petits lutins se lancent dans un spectacle explosif de leur cru en formant une main géante pour adresser un signe vraiment très mal élevé aux Veela, à l'autre bout du terrain...<br /><br />Bien avant la parution du quatrième volume de la série, Rowling avait prévenu qu'il serait plus sombre que le précédent et il est vrai qu'à chaque moment d'hilarité correspond un moment de frayeur où nous craignons pour la vie de Harry, les émotions soulevées par la lecture du livre étant à la mesure des dangers encourus par le héros.

Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar.<br /><br />On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family–and his adoptive brother–will be the most powerful force in his life.<br /><br />As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat–under the tutelage of one of Rome’s most fearsome gladiators–Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier’s proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win.<br /><br />The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict–a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. <br /><br />Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts–from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin.

Aesop was reputedly a tongue-tied slave who miraculously received the power of speech; from his legendary storytelling came the collections of prose and verse fables scattered throughout Greek and Roman literature.

16060,16060,9780415028257,988506,Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,"[Ludwig Wittgenstein, David Pears, Brian McGuinness]","Perhaps the most important work of philosophy written in the twentieth century, the <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> first appeared in 1921 and was the only philosophical work that Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) published during his lifetime. Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme compression and brilliance, it immediately convinced many of its readers and captivated the imagination of all. Its chief influence, at first, was on the Logical Positivists of the 1920s and 30s, but many other philosophers were stimulated by its philosophy of language, finding attractive, if ultimately unsatisfactory, its view that propositions were pictures of reality. Perhaps most of all, Wittgenstein himself, after his return to philosophy in the late 1920s, was fascinated by its vision of an inexpressible, crystalline world of logical relationships. The posthumous publication of other writings has, therefore, only served to reawaken interest in the <em>Tractatus</em> and to illuminate its more neglected aspects.<br />David Pears and Brian McGuinness revised their translation in the light of Wittgenstein's own suggestions and comments in his correspondence with C.K. Ogden about the first translation. In addition, this edition contains the introduction by Bertrand Russell which appeared in the original English translation.",4.07,18.0,,

No jargon, no graphs, no equations. Yet this is a comprehensive survey, covering everything from rent control and the rise and fall of businesses to the international balance of payments.The purpose of Basic Economics is to enable people without any economic training to understand the way the economy functions-not only the American economy, but other economies around the world.Some of the clearest demonstrations of the role of prices, for example, come from economies in which prices are not allowed to function-with consequences which show just what those functions are and what happens when they are lacking.In the end, this is not a book from which to cram facts, but one from which to gain an understanding of the economy that will enable you to form your own conclusions on the basis of tested principles, rather than on the basis of emotion or rhetoric.

More than any other modern writer in world literature, Kafka captures the loneliness and misery that fill the lives of 20th-century humanity. The Metamorphosis and Other Stories reveals the author’s extraordinary talent in a variety of forms—prose poems, short stories, sketches, allegories, and novelettes—and showcases the straight–faced humor, startling psychological insight, and haunting imagination for which he is revered as a modern master.

A star of the already prestigious Princeton and MIT mathematics departments in the 1950s, Nash was known for his ability to penetrate and solve ""deep problems"" -- those thought virtually unsolvable by his peers. His greatest contribution came with his advancement of game theory that revolutionized economics. A professor in his 20s, he was a leader in his field, a recognized genius. <p><br /><br />And then his life and career collapsed. In 1959, at the age of 30, Nash had a schizophrenic breakdown that saw him disappear from the world of mathematics. He lost his job, his wife, and, seemingly, his sanity.</p><p> <br /><br />Sylvia Nasar's detailed biography of the man, his achievements, and his descent into mental illness is as affectionate towards its subject as it is probing into the often oddly parallel worlds of academia and mental hospitals, genius and madness. </p><p><br /><br />Nasar stays focused on the life of Nash but manages to bring to it insights into the fine line between ill and well. Notably, her behind-the-scenes look at the Nobel Prize committee's consideration of Nash's work and their trepidation at awarding their prestigious prize to a ""madman"" is an interesting discussion. </p><p><br /><br />Ultimately, the story has a bizarre and happy ending.

17087,17087,9780849916731,395587,The Wounded Spirit,[Frank E. Peretti],"If you've ever been there,you've never forgotten. The feeling is as haunting and familiar as the smellof a junior high school locker room.<br /><br />It's the feeling of being undersized … or oversized … or klutzy … or less than beautiful. Of being a nerd … or a geek … or just, somehow, different.<br /><br />It's knowing you are vulnerable-and someone is ready and willing to take full advantage of your weakness by making your life miserable.<br /><br />It's the fraternity you never wanted to join-the fellowship of the wounded spirit.<br /><br />And bestselling novelist Frank Peretti is a member, too.<br /><br /><br />This book is the haunting true story of pain Frank Peretti never forgot but never, until recently, shared with the world. It's the story of growing up with a medical condition that left him disfigured. A series of surgeries and the slow miracle of answered prayer took care of the deformity, but not the underdeveloped frame or the excruciating reality of being different. And it was for these petty ""crimes"" that Peretti was prosecuted every day at school-especially in gym class, but also in the halls, on the school grounds, even in his own neighborhood. No wonder he found himself relating to movie monsters who were hated but also feared-and who eventually exacted a bloody revenge on their tormentors!<br /><br /><br />In Peretti's case, deliverance eventually came-through time, through prayer, through a teacher's caring intervention, and his own willingness to seek help. But he has never forgotten what life was like at the bottom of the junior high food<br />chain. And from the reservoir of those agonizing memories he sends a compelling message to victims, to bullies, and to authorities who have the power to intervene-that it's never OK for the strong to abuse the weak. And that we allow such abuse at the expense of our souls … and our very civilization.<br /><br />Especially in the wake of the massacre at Columbine High School-perpetuated by two troubled but also tormented outsiders--this message takes on haunting resonance. Frank Peretti believes we cannot afford to overlook the continuing reality of wounded spirits, not only in our schools, but in our homes, churches, and workplaces. His approach is both tender and tough as he issues a ringing call for a change in attitude.<br /><br />It's a call for all of us to stop thinking of abuse as ""normal,"" even among kids.<br /><br />It's a call for the strong to stand up and protect the weak, not prey upon them.<br /><br />It's a call for those in authority to pay attention to the violence being done to the vulnerable in the midst of our everyday lives and to take action to help.<br /><br /><br />Most of all, it's a call for bullies and victims alike (many of us are both) to seek the healing and forgiveness offered in Jesus Christ. For that healing is really the heart of this book-the only reality that can break the natural cycle of victimization and abuse.<br /><br />Only in Christ, Peretti reminds, is there hope for the wounded spirits-but that hope is<br />powerful enough to change everything.",4.07,17.0,,

17151,17151,9781853261589,136538,The Little Prince,"[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Irene Testot-Ferry]","Antoine de Saint-Exupéry first published <i>The Little Prince</i> in 1943, only a year before his Lockheed P-38 vanished over the Mediterranean during a reconnaissance mission. More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. ""In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey,"" the narrator recalls. ""Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket."" And so begins their dialogue, which stretches the narrator's imagination in all sorts of surprising, childlike directions.<p> The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exupéry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too. There's the king, for example, who commands the Little Prince to function as a one-man (or one-boy) judiciary: </p><blockquote>I have good reason to believe that there is an old rat living somewhere on my planet. I hear him at night. You could judge that old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. That way his life will depend on your justice. But you'll pardon him each time for economy's sake. There's only one rat. </blockquote> The author pokes similar fun at a businessman, a geographer, and a lamplighter, all of whom signify some futile aspect of adult existence. Yet his tale is ultimately a tender one--a heartfelt exposition of sadness and solitude, which never turns into <i>Peter Pan</i>-style treacle. Such delicacy of tone can present real headaches for a translator, and in her 1943 translation, Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard (who did a fine nip-and-tuck job on Stendhal's <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> in 1999) has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect. The result is a new and improved version of an indestructible classic, which also restores the original artwork to full color. ""Trying to be witty,"" we're told at one point, ""leads to lying, more or less."" But Saint-Exupéry's drawings offer a handy rebuttal: they're fresh, funny, and like the book itself, rigorously truthful. <i>--James Marcus</i>",4.31,18.0,,

And in <i>Stiff,</i> she explores the ""lives"" of human cadavers from the time of the ancient Egyptians all the way up to current campaigns for human composting.

Readers will come away convinced of the enormous debt that we, the living, owe to the study of the remains of the dead.

Yet many fear that scientific discoveries about innate patterns of thinking and feeling may be used to justify inequality, to subvert social change, and to dissolve personal responsibility. <br /><br /> In <i>The Blank Slate</i>, Steven Pinker explores the idea of human nature and its moral, emotional, and political colorings. He shows how many intellectuals have denied the existence of human nature and instead have embraced three dogmas: The Blank Slate (the mind has no innate traits), The Noble Savage (people are born good and corrupted by society), and The Ghost in the Machine (each of us has a soul that makes choices free from biology). Each dogma carries a moral burden, so their defenders have engaged in desperate tactics to discredit the scientists who are now challenging them. <br /><br /> Pinker provides calm in the stormy debate by disentangling the political and moral issues from the scientific ones. He shows that equality, compassion, responsibility, and purpose have nothing to fear from discoveries about an innately organized psyche. Pinker shows that the new sciences of mind, brain, genes, and evolution, far from being dangerous, are complementing observations about the human condition made by millennia of artists and philosophers.

19247,19247,9780553381351,586472,The Right Stuff,[Tom Wolfe],"Tom Wolfe began <i>The Right Stuff</i> at a time when it was unfashionable to contemplate American heroism. Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. ""<i>The Right Stuff</i>,"" he explains, ""became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero."" <p> Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with <i>In Cold Blood</i>. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his ""characters"" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.</p><p> Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon). The author also produces an admiring portrait of John Glenn's apple-pie heroism and selfless dedication. By the time Wolfe concludes with a return to Yeager and his late-career exploits, the narrative's epic proportions and literary merits are secure. Certainly <i>The Right Stuff</i> is the best, the funniest, and the most vivid book ever written about America's manned space program. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>",4.23,19.0,,

Plotkin],"For thousands of years, healers have used plants to cure illness. Aspirin, the world's most widely used drug, is based on compounds originally extracted from the bark of a willow tree, and more than a quarter of medicines found on pharmacy shelves contain plant compounds. Now Western medicine, faced with health crises such as AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, has begun to look to the healing plants used by indigenous peoples to develop powerful new medicines. Nowhere is the search more promising than in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical forest, home to a quarter of all botanical species on this planet—as well as hundreds of Indian tribes whose medicinal plants have never been studied by Western scientists. In <i>Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice</i>, ethnobotanist Mark J. Plotkin recounts his travels and studies with some of the most powerful Amazonian shamans, who taught him the plant lore their tribes have spent thousands of years gleaning from the rain forest.For more than a decade, Dr. Plotkin has raced against time to harvest and record new plants before the rain forests' fragile ecosystems succumb to overdevelopment—and before the Indians abandon their own culture and learning for the seductive appeal of Western material culture. <i>Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice</i> relates nine of the author's quests, taking the reader along on a wild odyssey as he participates in healing rituals; discovers the secret of curare, the lethal arrow poison that kills in minutes; tries the hallucinogenic snuff epena that enables the Indians to speak with their spirit world; and earns the respect and fellowship of the mysterious shamans as he proves that he shares both their endurance and their reverence for the rain forest.

Griffin seeks the truth--and finds himself confronted with the leader of the Survivors Club. Jillian Hayes is beautiful, successful, cool as ice, and she harbors a pain that mirrors Griffin's own.

We feel, says the novelist, 'the unbearable lightness of being' - not only as the consequence of our private acts but also in the public sphere, and the two inevitably intertwine.<br /><br />Juxtaposing Prague, Geneva, Thailand and the United States, this masterly novel encompasses the extremes of comedy and tragedy, and embraces, it seems, all aspects of human existence.

Hobbits are cheerful and shy, enjoy large meals and long naps, and almost never lock their doors at night. But dark forces from the enemy land of Mordor threaten these lovable beings, along with the other inhabitants of Middle-earth - dwarves, elves, and even men.<br /><br />A the center of the saga is Frodo Baggins and the magical ring he inherited from his older cousin Bilbo (hero of Tolkien's earlier novel The Hobbit), a ring that has the power to corrupt even the strongest soul with a lust for power. From the wise wizard Gandalf, Frodo learns that he must abandon his comfortable hobbit hole in the Shire and with a band of brave companions, set off on a perilous journey to save the ring from enemy hands. They are pursued along the way by Orcs and the terrifying Black Riders commanded by Sauron the Dark Lord of Mordor; and they are hunted by the treacherous Gollum, who once owned the ring.

Then, amazed, Richard Papen is drawn into the ultimate inner circle: five students, worldly and self-assured, selected by a charismatic classics professor to participate in the search for truth and beauty. Together they study the mysteries of ancient Greek culture and spend long weekends at an old country house, reading, boating, basking in an Indian summer that stretches late into autumn.

But once taken into their confidence, he and the others slowly and inevitably begin to believe in the necessity of murdering the one classmate and friend who might betray both their secret and their future. Hugely ambitious and compulsively readable, this is a chronicle of deception and complicity, of Dionysian abandon, of innocence corrupted by self-love and moral arrogance; and, finally, it is a story of guilt and responsibility.

22208,22208,9789750806285,25997858,Nimet Geldi Ekine: Türkiye'nin Ekmeklerinin Öyküsü,"[Artun Ünsal, Murat Germen]","Bir Anadolu bilmecesinde “Allah’ın hikmeti, kulun nimeti nedir?” diye sorulur. Yanıt “ekmek”tir.<br /><br />Ekmeğe “nimet” der Anadolulu. Çünkü ekin, buğday ve ekmek, dünya tarihinde ilk kültür tarımının yapıldığı bölgelerden biri olan Anadolu’da yaşayanların adeta genlerine sinmiştir. Yoksulu da varsılı da, hükmedeni de hükmedileni de doyuran ekmek, bir lûtuftur. Tanrılar esip gürleyince onların kızgınlıklarını yatıştırmak için, bol ekin verdiklerinde ise onlara şükür için sunulan adaktır. Bir Musevinin Tanrıya sunduğu ekmek mayasız olmalıdır. Bir Hıristiyan için ekmek İsa’dır. Bir Müslüman için kutsal bir yiyecektir; yere düşünce öpülüp alna götürülecek kadar kutsal. Tür ve pişirme yöntemleri açısından çağlara, ülkelere, bölgelere, yaşayışlara göre farklılık gösteren ekmek, bir kültürel değerdir aynı zamanda. Anadolu tasavvufunda çok önemli bir metafordur. Mevlânâ Divân-ı Kebir’de seslenir: “Ey bâtıl ümmet, ekmek için savaşın, ekmeğe koşun...” Ve ekmek, alın terinin hak edilmiş karşılığıdır. Hepimiz biliriz; ekmekler ufalırken, insanlar mutsuzlaşır. <br /><br />Nimet Geldi Ekine – Türkiye’nin Ekmeklerinin Öyküsü, Artun Ünsal’ın Anadolu’daki peynir ve zeytin/zeytinyağı kültürlerini araştırma serüveninin ardından, yazarı ve okuru kültürümüzde yeni ufuklara taşıyan yeni bir yolculuk. Dünyada kişi başına en çok tahıl tüketilen ülkelerden biri olan, yüzlerce çeşit ekmeğin yapıldığı Türkiye’de, ekmeğin öyküsü ihmal edilemezdi kuşkusuz. Artun Ünsal ve Murat Germen’in, Marmara’dan Ege’ye, Karadeniz’den Doğu ve Güneydoğu Anadolu’ya, Akdeniz’den İç Anadolu’ya uzanarak giriştikleri bu keşif yolculuğu yalnızca Türkiye’nin ekmeklerinin öyküsünü değil, Türkiye’yi ve Türkiyeliyi de anlatıyor bize. <br /><br />Kapak Fotoğrafı: İvriz Kaya Kabartması, Konya-Ereğli, M.Ö. 8. yüzyıl.",4.33,18.0,,
